# Abstract 

The analysis of biological signals has a strong mathematical and statistical foundation. In the scope of neuropathologies, information theory is a widely used tool for the analysis of electroencephalograhy signals. The present work proposes to identify the hubs present during the ictal period of epilepsy episodes from two information measures: Phase Locking Value (PLV) and Transfer Entropy. It was noticed that, given its directional nature, the transfer entropy presented more specific results for the identification of the anatomical region of the hubs.
